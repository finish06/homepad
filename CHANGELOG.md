# Changelog

All notable changes to homepad are documented here.
Versions align with the homepad milestone naming: v9, v10, v11 → semver major.

## [11.0.0] — 2026-06-18

### Admin/Personal Scope Clarity (#52/#55/#61)

The admin vs. personal settings split was confusing after the v9 per-user model
shipped: "Edit dashboard" and "Admin settings" sat side by side with no scope
signal, the Settings modal was titled "Settings" (reads as personal, behaves as
global), and non-admins had no explanation of where their settings lived.

**Changes:**
- `UserMenu.tsx`: ADMIN section divider (shield icon, amber styling) groups
  admin-only items and separates them from personal actions. "Edit dashboard"
  gets a **personal** scope tag; "Admin settings" gets a **global** scope tag
  (amber). Non-admin users see a "Your tiles… are your personal dashboard" note.
- `SettingsPanel.tsx`: modal retitled **"Admin Panel"** (was "Settings");
  subtitle added: "Changes here are global — they affect all users on this
  homepad." App Library section note updated to say "all users"; System section
  note updated to say "globally to all accounts."
- `Catalog.tsx` (#61): edit-mode banner "Editing your personal dashboard" is
  gated on `adminEdit` (not the general `editMode` flag) so it shows exactly
  when an admin is editing their personal tiles.

All existing `data-testid` values preserved. 325 vitest passing, 0 axe
violations (jest-axe on UserMenu admin role).

### UserMenu Dropdown Z-Index Fix (#57/#58)

The sticky `<header>` at `z-10` established a stacking context; the tile
drag-grips (also `z-10`, later in DOM order) painted over the open UserMenu
dropdown, making menu items unreachable while tiles were present.

**Fix:** `AppHeader.tsx` header lifted from `z-10` → `z-20`. This clears the
grips' `z-10` while remaining below the launcher overlay (`z-60`) and
ServiceForm modal (`z-20` but rendered after the header, so DOM order prevails).

### Real-Browser Regression Gate for Z-Index (#59/#60)

`tests/browser-gate/header-zindex.spec.ts` added: a Playwright spec that opens
the UserMenu dropdown, finds every drag-grip that geometrically overlaps the
dropdown, and asserts `document.elementFromPoint` at each overlap centre returns
a node inside the dropdown, not the grip. This test is invisible to jsdom (no
z-index, no hit-testing) and requires real Chromium — same pattern as the #35
gate. Reverts the header to `z-10` → this spec goes red.
